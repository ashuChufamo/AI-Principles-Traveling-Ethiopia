Final Course Project
This repository contains the main code for the final course project. The FinalCourseProject.ipynb file is the main code file that demonstrates the implementation of all the questions from 1 through 5.

Usage
To run the code, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. Open the FinalCourseProject.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to see the implementation of the project.

Question 5 Models
In addition to the main code, we have included the models used for the 5th question in two separate folders:

38-futuristic-trike-high-poly
70-futuristic_trike_high-poly_2-extensible-3d-relative
Feel free to explore these folders to access the models used for the 5th question.
